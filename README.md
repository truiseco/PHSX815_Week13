## K-Means Clustering

This repository contains the following program(s):

- `HW13/KMeans.x` : A very simple implementation of the K-means clustering
                    algorithm, which generates its own randomized data then
                    sorts into clusters and plots the results. [C++]

### Requirements

In order to compile (by typing `make`) and run the C++ examples, you
need the ROOT package installed (for visualization):
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (C++)

### Usage

The executable can be called from the command line.
